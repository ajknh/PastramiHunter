This is the Game Jam Game GitHub repository.
This uses PyGame. To install it, please see https://www.pygame.org  
  
Please see a basic outline of the Pygame structure at basicpygame/basicoutline.py

## Basic Pygame code outline:
1. While not done:
	- For each event (keypress, mouse click, etc.):

	- Run calculations to determine where objects move, what happens when objects collide, etc.
	- Clear the screen
	- Draw everything
